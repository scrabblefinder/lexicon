        What is an Anagram Solver?
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        An anagram solver is a powerful tool that helps you discover all possible word combinations that can be created by rearranging a set of letters. Whether you're a word game enthusiast, crossword puzzle solver, or simply looking to expand your vocabulary, an anagram solver can be an invaluable resource.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept is simple: you input a word or a set of letters, and the anagram solver will generate all valid words that can be formed using those exact letters. For example, if you input "listen," the solver might return "silent," "inlets," and "enlist" - all words that use the same set of letters in different arrangements.

        How to Use Our Anagram Solver
      </h3>

      <p>
        Our anagram solver includes a unique feature: the ability to use wildcards (?) for unknown letters. This is particularly useful when you're working on word puzzles or games where some letters are unknown. For instance, if you know a word contains "c?t," you might find matches like "cat," "cut," or "cot."

      <p>
        The solver works by analyzing your input and comparing it against an extensive dictionary of valid words. It considers all possible letter combinations and returns only legitimate words, making it a reliable tool for:
